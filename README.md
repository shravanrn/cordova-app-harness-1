cordova-app-harness
===================

An App harness for Cordova that can download and run Cordova apps as well as Chrome packaged apps. This enables an edit &amp; refresh workflow. Also enables local development of apps without needing the Android / iOS SDK.

##Setting up environment

*   Clone the the cordova-app-harness, cordova-android, cordova-ios, cordova-js, plugman, cordova-cli, zip(https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/zip) and AppBundle(https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/AppBundle) repos into folders of the same name in a common directory - eg 'Repo'.
*   Use the future branch for cordova-cli and master everywhere else
*   Link these plugman and cordova-cli of this branch as the globally symlinked plugman and cordova-cli commands. (You may want to see 'npm link')
*   Build the cordova-js repo and grab the cordova.android.js and cordova.ios.js
*   Replace the cordova-cli/lib/cordova-android/framework/assets/js/cordova.android.js and the cordova-cli/lib/cordova-ios/CordovaLib/cordova.ios.js files with the ones above
*   Build the cordova-android repository and generate new cordova.jar
*   Run the following commands

        cordova create CordovaAppHarness
        cd CordovaAppHarness
        cordova platform add android
        cordova platform add ios
        cordova plugin add ../Repo/AppBundle
        cordova plugin add ../Repo/zip/
        cp -rf ../Repo/cordova-app-harness/www app/www
        cordova prepare

*   Put the cordova.jar in the CordovaAppHarness/platforms/android/libs folder. (Note you may want to link the cordova-android project directly instead of adding a built jar so you can easily make changes to cordova-android and test the app harness)
*   Replace the contents of CordovaAppHarness/platforms/ios/CordovaLib with /Repo/cordova-ios/CordovaLib
*   Go to eclipse and got to new, other, android, android project from existing code. Navigate to CordovaAppHarness/platforms/android and then add the project
*   Double click the  .xcodeproj file in CordovaAppHarnessNew/platforms/ios/
*   Ensure the config.xml for android (Project Folder In IDE/res/xml/config.xml) and ios (Project Folder In IDE/config.xml) have the content tag's src set to

        <content src="app-bundle:///cdvah_index.html" />

*   Ensure the config.xml for ios has the tag

        <access origin="app-bundle://*" />

*   You can now build the app harness from the ides or with cordova compile

##Features
*   Install and test multiple applications.
*   Run apps locally or run them directly from cordova serve.
*   Edit and Refresh workflow with cordova serve.
*   In App context menu to switch between apps.
*   Firebug Lite and Weinre support for debugging.
*   Support for bundle paths such as "file:///android_asset/www" - These point to the tested application's bundle and not the app harness' bundle. (In development)

##Install an app in the harness

*   Install the app in one of the two ways below

###Test by installing the app on the phone through app harness
*   Run the packapp script and point it to a cordova project of the app you want to test. This will package the app into a cdvh file. (Note: it is expected that you have added all relevant platforms. For example, if you want to test on the iphone, you need to have added the ios platform to the project)
        Repo/cordova-app-harness/packapp -p ./TestApp TestApp.cdvh
*   Upload the the cdvh onto any hosting site.
*   Run the app harness
*   Click add new app
*   Give a name and the url to the cdvh file.

        Name: App1
        URL to file: http://www.somesite.com/myapp.cdvh

###Test by using cordova serve
*   Go to cordova project of the app you want to test in a terminal and run.
        cordova prepare
        cordova serve <platform>
*   If you want to test the app in an actual device, find the network address of your computer by running
        ifconfig
*   If you are running this on a simulator, you can use "http://localhost" as your address
*   Click add new app
*   Choose the option "Enter the URL to the server hosting the app"
*   Give a name and the url as follows. Let's assume the network address discovered above is a.b.c.d

        Name: App1
        URL to server: http://a.b.c.d:8000/config.xml

*   Go back to the main screen after you see the prompt "successfully installed"

##Running an app in the harness
*   Click launch on the installed app
*   See if the app looks as expected
*   Use the 3 finger tap to access the app menu while testing your app
*   The context menu that pops up, will allow you to return to the main screen, restart or update the app, open a firebug console in the device, setup remote debugging using weinre etc.
